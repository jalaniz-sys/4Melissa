Midnight. Not a sound from the pavement. Suddenly an explosion of music and lights reveals a larger-than life junkyard. Probing car lights tear across the darkened landscape of bottles and boxes, briefly catching the darting image of a running cat. Tonight is the one special night each year when the tribe of Jellicle Cats reunites to celebrate who they are. And its their chance to be chosen to go to the Heavy Side Layer and be reborn again into a new life. Grizabella appears once more, wanting to rejoin her family and be a part of the celebration. She is left to contemplate her Memory of the time before she left the tribe. She stretches out her hand behind her, hoping another cat will touch her. She is still not accepted and, disappointed, slinks off into the night.

(Cats gathered and showered Rumtum with compliments) Act 3: Grizabella the glamorous cat (Grizabella enter and wants to go back to the Jellicle tribe, but the tribe refuses to) Grizabella:

REMARK THE CAT WHO HESITATES TOWARD YOU IN THE LIGHT OF THE DOOR WHICH OPENS ON HER LIKE A GRIN YOU SEE THE BORDER OF HER COAT IS TORN AND STAINED WITH SAND AND YOU SEE THE CORNER OF HER EYE TWIST LIKE A CROOKED PIN

Demeter:

SHE HAUNTED MANY A LOW RESORT NEAR THE GRIMY ROAD OF TOTTENHAM COURT SHE FLITTED ABOUT THE NO MAN’S LAND FROM ‘THE RISING SUN’ TO ‘THE FRIEND AT HAND’ AND THE POSTMAN SIGHED AS HE SCRATCHED HIS HEAD ‘YOU REALLY HAD THOUGHT SHE’D OUGHT TO BE DEAD AND WHO WOULD EVER SUPPOSE THAT THAT

He took our food, our things, everything! (Exclaiming) MUSIC 4: MACAVITY THE MYSTERY CAT Cat 6: Who is Macavity! SOLO: Macavity's a mystery cat, he's called the hidden paw For he's a master criminal who can defy the law He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair For when they reach the scene of crime Macavity's not there!

Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity He's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare And when you reach the scene of crime Macavity's not there!

You may seek him in the basement, you may look up in the air But I tell you once and once again Macavity's not there!

SOLO: Macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin You would know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunken in His brow is deeply lined in thought, his head is highly domed His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed He sways his head from side to side with movements like a snake And when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake

Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity He's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square But when a crime's discovered then Macavity's not there!

SOLO: He's outwardly respectable, I know he cheats at cards And his footprints are not found in any files of Scotland Yard's And when the larder's looted or the jewel case is rifled Or when the milk is missing or another peke's been stifled Or the greenhouse glass is broken and the trellis past repair

There's the wonder of the thing Macavity's not there!

Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity He always has an alibi and one or two to spare What ever time the deed took place Macavity wasn't there!

ALL 3: Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity

He's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare And when you reach the scene of crime Macavity's not there!

Act 5: Grizabella begs her former tribemate to accept her againg while reminiscing the memory she had with the Jellicle tribe. MUSIC 5: MEMORY (reprise) GRIZABELLA: Memory Turn your face to the moonlight Let your memory lead you Open up, enter in If you find there the meaning of what happiness is Then a new life will begin
Memory All alone in the moonlight I can smile at the old days I was beautiful then I remember a time I knew what happiness was Let the memory live again

Burnt out ends of smokey days The stale cold smell of morning A streetlamp dies - another night is over Another day is dawning

Daylight I must wait for the sunrise I must think of a new life

And I mustn't give in When the dawn comes, tonight will be a memory too And a new day will begin

Solo: Sunlight through the trees in summer Endless masquerading Like a flower as the dawning is breaking The memory is fading

Grizabella: Touch me It's so easy to leave me All alone with a memory Of my days in the sun If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is Look, a new day has begun
