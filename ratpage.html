    Acacia senegal (AS) gum (Gum Arabic) is a natural emulsifier exudate from the branches and trunk of Acacia trees and it is recognized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) agency as a secure dietary fiber. The present research evaluated the systemic oxidative and necroinflammatory stress induced by CCl4 administration and the alleviating effect of AS gum aqueous extract (ASE, 7.5 g/Kg b.w.). The results demonstrated the presence of certain phenolic compounds in ASE, as well as its in vitro potent scavenging ability against ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), NO, and lipid peroxide radicals. Also, the outcomes revealed an improvement in the CCl4-induced liver, lung, brain, and spleen toxicity by reducing the levels of ROS, lipid peroxidation, NO, and the gene expression of NF-κB and its relevant ROS-mediated inflammatory genes. In contrast, the total antioxidant capacity (TAC), as well as the enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, were significantly upregulated in these organs after the treatment with ASE. These results were confirmed by improving the morphological features of each organ. Therefore, ASE can ameliorate the systemic toxicity caused by CCl4 via regulation of the ROS/NF-κB signaling pathway in the rat organs, which is owed to its phytochemical composition.

Introduction
Oxidative stress exhibits an asymmetry between the exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the ability of the physiological system to directly scavenge the reactive intermediates or adjust the outcome damage1. Disturbances in the normal redox state of cells can produce lethal results by building ROS that damage all cell parts, involving lipids, proteins, and DNA1,2. ROS plays also a crucial role in the pathogenesis of various human organs, including the liver, heart, lung, spleen, and kidney3,4. ROS has an important role in the modulation of the nuclear factor-kappa (NF-κ)B pathway, so there is an interplay between this pathway and cellular oxidative stress. NF-κB is a member of a family of inducible transcription factors involved in immunological and inflammatory responses induced by pathogens or cytokines, along with cell proliferation and survival. It is a key player in the stimulation of pro-inflammatory genes in both innate and adaptive immune cells, including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α5. Various toxic chemicals, such as carbon tetrachloride (CC14), bromobenzene, aromatic hydrocarbons, and methanol6, are implicated in the development of organ damage by modulating the ROS/NF-κB signaling pathway6,7. The CCl4 is a prevalent hepatotoxin used to provoke liver complications in various experimental studies8,9. Its hepatotoxic effect has been histologically demonstrated to cause fibrosis, hepatocellular death, and cirrhosis10,11. The CCl4 is incorporated with its quick break by cytochrome P450 (CYP2E1) in liver cells, providing trichloromethyl radicals (CCl3*) driving lipid peroxidation and subsequent membrane impairment4,10. In addition to this, CCl4 caused activation of hepatic Kupffer cells that generate inflammatory mediators and ROS, yielding an ending in hepatic parenchymal cells' distress2,11. Other organs such as the kidney, lung, and spleen can also be harmed by CCl412.

Nowadays, numerous functional foods and their ingredients are involved in the amelioration of the chemical's toxicity due to their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory roles13,14,15,16,17,18. Acacia Senegal (AS) gum (Gum Arabic), which is a naturally occurring exudate derived from the trunk and branches of AS and Acacia seyal trees, is one of these functional foods that have numerous medicinal effects. It is a dietary fibre that is neutral or slightly acidic and occurs naturally as a mixed magnesium, calcium, and potassium salt polysaccharidic acid19,20. AS gum has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities and protects from kidney, liver, and heart injury. It also ameliorates some biochemical, physiological, and behavioral effects in rats21,22 besides its ability to relieve the disadvantageous effects of chronic kidney malfunction in humans20,22. Few previous studies have assessed the ameliorative effect of AS gum on the drug and chemical-induced toxicity23,24, but no study has evaluated its effect on CCl4-induced systemic damage. Thus, the present work was conducted to evaluate the therapeutic effect of AS gum aqueous extract (ASE) on the CCl4-induced toxicity in rat liver, lung, brain, and spleen tissues. The necroinflammatory and oxidative stress mediators have been examined due to their critical role in systemic destruction. Moreover, the phytochemistry and the in vitro antioxidant activity of ASE were assessed to provide more persuasive proof of its therapeutic opportunities.

Results
Phenolic content and antioxidant activity of ASE
The phytochemical analysis showed that ASE contains some amounts of phenolic compounds (0.717 ± 0.102 mg gallic acid eq/g ASE) and has no flavonoids. Certain types of these phenolic compounds were identified by HPLC (Fig. 1A), such as gallic acid (0.1 µg/g ASE), ellagic acid (1.6 µg/g ASE), benzoic acid (0.3 µg/g ASE), and O-coumaric acid (0.1 µg/g ASE). However, the retention times (RT) of the other tested standard phenolics (catechol, caffeine, vanillin, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, cinnamic acid, and salicylic acid) didn’t match any RT in the ASE chromatogram.
Regarding the antioxidant activity of ASE (Fig. 1B), it exhibited potent anti-lipid peroxidation activity (β-carotene bleaching activity) that was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) by 73.754%. In addition, it showed high scavenging ability against the ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) cation radical and NO radical, but less than that of BHT by 1187.058% and 714.527%, respectively.

The ameliorating effect of ASE on CCl4-induced systemic toxicity
The potency of ASE against CCl4-induced toxicity in the liver, lung, brain, and spleen was evaluated by its ability to restore the cellular redox state and reduce necroinflammation in these tissues.

Organ/body weight ratio and liver function markers
The organ/b.w ratio results showed a non-significant difference between all the studied groups for the liver and brain tissues. However, a significant (P < 0.05) elevation in these ratios was observed in the lung and spleen tissues after CCl4 administration only, by 276.431 and 86.067%, respectively (Fig. 1C).

The serum analysis for the liver function markers (Fig. 1D) showed a significant (P < 0.05) decline in the ALT activity (75.146%) and albumin level (36.707%) in the rats that were injected with CCl4 compared to the control rats. The remaining studied serum markers (AST and total proteins) revealed slight changes (7.323% and 3.287%, respectively) from the control. Concerning rats in the CCl4-ASE group, the ALT activity and albumin level were significantly (P < 0.05) increased by 604.471% and 21.081%, respectively, but there was no change in the AST activity (21.254%) and total protein level (6.134%) compared to those in the CCl4 group. The V group displayed a non-significant difference in the ALT activity (13.255%), AST activity (2.834%), albumin level (3.584%), and total protein level (7.658%), relative to the control. Similarly, the serum of rats that were administered ASE alone showed slight differences in the AST activity (5.883%), albumin level (12.640%), and total protein level (9.550%), relative to control. In contrast, the activity of ALT was significantly (P < 0.05) elevated (195.865%) in the rats of this group compared to that in the C group.

Improving the CCl4-induced hepatic redox state disturbance by ASE
Figure 2A,B, and D show that CCl4 induced hepatic oxidative stress, which was explained by a significant (P < 0.05) elevation of ROS (256.163%), NO (369.80%), and lipid peroxidation (904.382%) levels, as well as myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (163.715%) compared to the C group. This was connected with a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in the TAC (55.495%), enzymatic [superoxide dismutase "SOD" (46.893%) and glutathione peroxidase "GPX" (81.913%)] and non-enzymatic [reduced glutathione "GSH" (54.123%)] antioxidants relative to the C group (Fig. 2A,C,D). While the administration of ASE after CCl4 injection (CCl4-ASE group) significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the levels of ROS, NO, TBARS, and the activity of MPO by 48.057%, 59.599%, 68.208%, and 26.847%, respectively, relative to the CCl4 group (Fig. 2A,B,D). Moreover, ASE significantly (P < 0.05) augmented the levels of hepatic TAC (103.374%) and GSH (19.864%), and the activities of GPX (346.491%) and SOD (92.01%) compared to those in the CCl4 group (Fig. 2A,C,D).
Regarding rats that were injected with olive oil alone (V group), they showed non-significant changes in all the studied oxidative stress parameters. The changes in ROS, TAC, TBARS, NO, GPX, GSH, SOD and MPO were 7.520%, 21.979%, 21.823%, 34.118%, 3.536%, 3.339%, 12.207%, and 4.219%, respectively, compared to those in the control rats. On the other hand, the rats that were administered ASE alone for 10 days (ASE group) showed a non-significant change in the levels of ROS, TAC, TBARS, and NO and the activity of SOD and MPO compared to the control (7.779%, 6.143%, 5.492%, 1.859%, 3.550%, and 5.953%, respectively). While the activity of GPX and the level of GSH were significantly (P < 0.05) elevated by 12.783% and 20.611%, respectively, when compared to those in the C group (Fig. 2C).

Improving the CCl4-induced brain redox state disturbance by ASE
Figure 3A and B show the toxic effect of CCl4 on brain tissue through the induction of oxidative stress, which was indicated by the significant (P < 0.05) rise in the levels of intracellular ROS (185.182%), NO (140.579%), and TBARS (480.468%) as compared to the C group. Otherwise, there was a non-significant (36.179%) difference in the MPO activity in the brain tissue of the CCl4-injected rats and the control ones (Fig. 3D). Moreover, the cellular redox state (TAC), the activity of GPX and SOD, and the level of GSH were extremely reduced by 63.778%, 42.000%, 37.463%, and 58.677%, respectively, compared to the C group (Fig. 3A,C,D). Treatment of CCl4-injected rats with ASE (CCl4-ASE group) significantly incremented the cellular redox state of the brain tissue. This was shown by a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in the levels of accumulated intracellular ROS (28.951%), TBARS (61.184%), and NO (46.038%), respectively relative to that of the CCl4 group (Fig. 3A,B). In contrast, the data analysis found a significant increase (P < 0.05) in the TAC (48.006%) and GSH (59.799%) levels and the GPX (51.519%) and SOD (72.019%) activities after ASE treatment compared to those in the CCl4 group (Fig. 3A,C,D). While a non-significant change (41.511%) was observed in the activity of MPO in this group compared to those in the CCl4 group (Fig. 3D).
The results also detected a significant (P < 0.05) elevation in the ROS, TBARS, and NO levels in the brain of rats injected with olive oil only (V group) compared to those in the control group (Fig. 3A,B). However, the antioxidant indices in the brain of these rats (Fig. 3A,C,D), such as the TAC (44.444%), GSH (29.822%), GPX (17.578%), and SOD (30.741%) were significantly (P < 0.05) diminished relative to control. But the MPO activity was decreased insignificantly (17.903%) in the brain tissue of these rats, relative to the control group (Fig. 3D).On the other hand, administration of ASE alone (ASE group) had insignificant effects on the levels of ROS (11.584%), TAC (0.500%), TBARS (11.519%), NO (0%), and GSH (8.239%) or the activities of GPX (3.209%), SOD (7.587%), and MPO (30.220%) compared to those in the control group.

Improving the CCl4-induced lung redox state disturbance by ASE
Figure 4A and B show that CCl4 caused harm to the lung redox state with a massive rise in the levels of ROS (591.297%) and NO (483.908%), compared to those in the C group, which led to an incredible formation of TBARS (361.120%). Also, compared to that of the control group, there was a significant increase in the MPO activity by 57.318%. Conversely, the lung enzymatic (GPX and SOD) and non-enzymatic (GSH) antioxidants were enormously reduced by 69.426%, 27.635%, and 82.387%, respectively, compared to those in the C group (Fig. 4C,D). Consequently, TAC of lung tissue was significantly dropped in the CCl4-injected rats by 65.780%, related to the control group (Fig. 4A). The treatment with ASE after CCl4-injection (CCl4-ASE group) improved the redox state in lung tissue extremely. This was attributed to the significant (P < 0.05) decrease in the studied oxidative stress parameters, ROS, NO, TBARS, and MPO levels, by 43.448%, 50.098%, 72.211%, 20.594%, respectively, compared to those in the CCl4 group (Fig. 4A,B,D). Besides, ASE significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced the lung antioxidant system (GPX, GSH, and SOD) by 160.157%, 386.431%, and 48.505%, relative to the CCl4 group (Fig. 4C,D). These results led to an increase in the lung tissue TAC (64.683%) related to that in the CCl4 group (Fig. 4A).
On the other hand, the lung tissue of rats in the vehicle (V) group showed an alteration in the redox state parameters. Hence, ROS, NO, and TBARS were significantly (P < 0.05) increased by 43.619%, 158.818%, and 24.490%, compared to the C group. Also, the antioxidant parameters, including GPX (22.390%), GSH (24.611%), and SOD (3.469%) were depleted significantly (P < 0.05), and as a result, the TAC (27.389%) was decreased compared to the control group (Fig. 4A,C,D), while the activity of MPO in the lung of the rats in this group was insignificantly increased (0.456%), compared to that in the C group. Nevertheless, the administration of ASE alone for 10 days (ASE group) displayed non-significant changes in the studied oxidative stress parameters in lung tissue compared to the C group. These parameters include ROS (12.146%), TBARS (2.306%), NO (10.344%), MPO (11.409%), GPX (18.502%), GSH (5.813%), SOD (10.135%), and TAC (4.137%).

Improving the CCl4-induced spleen redox state disturbance by ASE
The results showed that CCl4 injection can also influence spleen oxidative stress and cause a massive elevation in ROS (292.700%) and NO (182.978%) levels, which led to an excessive generation of lipid peroxide (TBARS, 395.516%), compared to that of the C group (Fig. 5A,B). Likewise, there was a significant (P < 0.05) elevation in MPO activity (165.852%) compared to the control group (Fig. 5D). In contrast, there was a significant (P < 0.05) fall in the spleen antioxidant content, GPX (77.092%), GSH (75.735%), and SOD (50.388%), compared to the control group (Fig. 5C,D). Therefore, the TAC (63.063%) of spleen tissue was significantly (P < 0.05) diminished in the CCl4-injected rats, compared to the C group (Fig. 5A). Otherwise, the treatment of the CCl4-injected rats with ASE (CCl4-ASE group) enormously decreased the oxidative stress examined parameters, including ROS, NO, TBARS, and MPO level by 37.638%, 50.024%, 68.477%, 38.071%, sequentially, compared to those of the CCl4 group (Fig. 5A,B,D). Moreover, ASE enhanced the spleen antioxidant status by a significant (P < 0.05) elevation in the activity of GPX and SOD, and the level of GSH by 323.942%, 124.237%, and 126.792%, compared to those in the CCl4 group (Fig. 5C,D). In addition, the TAC of the spleen tissue was augmented by 195.244% more than the CCl4 group (Fig. 5A).
